Hello! My name is Jeffrey Varga, a senior at Oregon State University, double majoring in Geospatial Science and Piano Performance, and set to graduate in June 2025 with my first degree, and my second in Winter 2026. My academic and professional work focuses on applying GIS, remote sensing, and spatial analysis to real-world environmental and conservation challenges.

While earning my AAOT and GIS certificate at Southwestern Oregon Community College, I completed a GIS internship with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. During this internship, I led the digitization of historic vegetation data across 1,000+ square miles of the Coquille River Basin to reconstruct a pre-European settlement landscape. I also developed a 3D model in Blender and presented the project at the 2023 Oregon Chapter meeting of the American Fisheries Society. In the same internship, I assisted with fieldwork targeting invasive Smallmouth Bass, collecting geospatial data and supporting native Coho salmon recovery.

Since then, I’ve expanded my skills through advanced coursework in remote sensing, spatial statistics, atmospheric modellings, and conservation planning. My latest GIS projects include modeling dust dispersion patterns from the shrinking Great Salt Lake and analyzing optimal locations for vertical evacuation structures for the Ocean Shores community in Washington. See more about my projects <a href="/projects">here</a>.

Outside the geospatial world, I am a classically trained pianist with extensive solo and collaborative performance experience. I bring the same discipline and creative problem-solving from music into my GIS work.

As an Eagle Scout and recipient of the Vigil Honor, I value leadership, adaptability, and community engagement, qualities I aim to bring into every professional setting.
