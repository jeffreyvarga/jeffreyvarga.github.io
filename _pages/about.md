Hello! My name is Jeffrey Varga, a senior at Oregon State University, double majoring in Geospatial Science and Piano Performance. I graduated in June 2025 with my first degree (music), and my second in Winter 2026. My academic and professional work focuses on applying GIS, web GIS, remote sensing, and spatial analysis to real-world environmental and conservation challenges.

After stumvling across an entry-level cartography course during my first term at my community college, I've been passionate for cartography and GIS for many years now. Since then, I have done projects and work in many aspects of the geospatial world - from field data colleection to remote sensing.

I’ve expanded my skills through advanced coursework in remote sensing, spatial statistics, and conservation planning. My latest GIS projects include modeling dust dispersion patterns from the shrinking Great Salt Lake and analyzing optimal locations for vertical evacuation structures for the Ocean Shores community in Washington. See my projects <a href="/projects">here</a>.

Outside the geospatial world, I am a classically trained pianist with extensive solo and collaborative performance experience. I bring the same discipline and creative problem-solving from music into my GIS work.

As an Eagle Scout and recipient of the Vigil Honor, I value leadership, adaptability, and community engagement, qualities I aim to bring into every professional setting.
