This work focuses on evaluating pedestrian evacuation to safe zones for Ocean Shores East, a subsect of a community in Coastal Washington. Specifically, this work leverages the Pedestrian Evacuation Analyst Tool which is an ArcGIS extension that estimates how long it would take for someone travel on foot out of the tsunami inundation area. We found that the majority of the population will be unable to evacuate to higher ground within a threshold of time of 15-25 minutes between a Cascadia Subduction Zone event’s earthquake ground shaking and the first tsunami wave. It is necessary then to develop and optimize the design and construction of vertical evacuation structures in order to save as many lives as possible. Construction of vertical evacuation structures in the proposed parcel locations drastically increases the population able to evacuate within 25 minutes from 2% (the current estimate without structures) to over 90%.
